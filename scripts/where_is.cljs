;; Where a satellite is, from the element set the world publishes about it.
;;
;; The library returns refusals as values, because it is called in a loop over
;; thousands of objects. A command line is the one place that must not: a shell
;; reads exit status, and a refusal that exits 0 is indistinguishable from an
;; answer. So the three outcomes are three different exit codes.
;;
;;   0  every element set in the input produced a position
;;   1  at least one was REFUSED, and each refusal is named on stderr. Not
;;      "some worked so we are fine" -- a catalog with a bad entry must not
;;      exit like a clean one.
;;   2  the question could not be ASKED -- no network, no such object, no
;;      readable input, bad arguments. Not 1, because "we did not look" must
;;      not read as "we looked and that orbit is unsupported".
