  "The two-line element set, parsed by column.

  A TLE is a fixed-column punched-card format, not a delimited one. Two of
  its fields carry an *assumed* decimal point and a two-character exponent
  (`28098-4` means 0.28098e-4), and a whitespace-splitting parser gets those
  wrong in a way that still produces a number -- which is the failure mode
  worth designing against, because a wrong BSTAR does not crash a
  propagator, it just moves the satellite.

  So every field is taken by its documented column range, and the parse
  refuses rather than guesses.

  Refusals are values: `parse` returns
  `{:ok? false :error <keyword> :detail <string>}`, never an exception.
  A caller ingesting ten thousand TLEs must be able to drop the four bad
  ones and record why, without a try/catch per line."
