  "The whole suite, with a failure signal the caller can actually see.

  Two things this runner does deliberately:

  1. **It names every test namespace in one list and runs all of them.**
     A runner that requires namespaces for their side effects and then runs
     whatever registered itself will silently shrink when a require is
     dropped.
  2. **It sets a non-zero exit code on failure.** `cljs.test` reports to
     stdout; a caller reading `$?` sees 0 either way unless something does
     this. A suite whose red is invisible is not a suite."
